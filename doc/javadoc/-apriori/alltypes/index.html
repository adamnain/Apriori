<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.tasks/-abstract-task/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.tasks.AbstractTask</a></td>
<td>
<p>An abstract base class for all tasks, which execute a module multiple times in order to obtain
the results, which are requested according to a specific configuration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-apriori/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Apriori</a></td>
<td>
<p>An implementation of the Apriori algorithm for mining frequent item sets and (optionally)
generating association rules. The algorithm processes a set of transactions, of which each one
consists of multiple items.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.operators/-arithmetic-mean/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.operators.ArithmeticMean</a></td>
<td>
<p>An operator, which allows to average the heuristic values, which are calculated by applying
multiple metrics to a rule, according to the arithmetic mean operation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-association-rule/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.AssociationRule</a></td>
<td>
<p>An association rule of the form X -&amp;gt; Y, which consists of a body X and a head Y. Both, the
body and the head of an association rule consist of one or several items. These item sets must be
distinct. An association rule specifies, that if the items, which are contained by its body,
occur in a transaction, the items, which are given in its head, do also occur with a certain
probability.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.modules/-association-rule-generator/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.modules.AssociationRuleGenerator</a></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a class, which allows to generate association rules, must implement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.modules/-association-rule-generator-module/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.modules.AssociationRuleGeneratorModule</a></td>
<td>
<p>A module, which allows to generate association rules from frequent item sets. An association rule
specifies, that if certain items occur in a transaction, other items do also occur with a certain
probability. Among all possible association rules, which can be generated from the frequent item
sets, only those, whose "interestingly" according to the confidence metric is greater or equal
than a specific threshold, are taken into account.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.tasks/-association-rule-generator-task/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.tasks.AssociationRuleGeneratorTask</a></td>
<td>
<p>A task, which tries to generate a specific number of association rules.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.metrics/-confidence/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.metrics.Confidence</a></td>
<td>
<p>A metric, which measures the confidence of an association rule. By definition, confidence
measures the percentage of transactions for which the head of the rule is true, among all
transaction for which the body is true.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.metrics/-conviction/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.metrics.Conviction</a></td>
<td>
<p>A metric, which measures the conviction of an association rule. By definition, conviction is the
ratio of the expected frequency that a rule makes an incorrect prediction, if body and head were
independent, over the frequency of incorrect predictions. For example, a conviction of 1.2
states, that the items, which are contained in the body and head of a rule, occur together 1.2
times as often as if the association between head and body was purely random.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-filter/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Filter</a></td>
<td>
<p>A filter, which can be applied to item sets or association rules.</p>

<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a data structure, which is filterable using a predicate function or
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-filter/index.html">Filter</a> instance, must implement.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>Defines the interface, a class, which allows to find frequent item sets, must implement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.modules/-frequent-item-set-miner-module/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.modules.FrequentItemSetMinerModule</a></td>
<td>
<p>A module, which allows to find all frequent item sets, which occur in a data set. The data set
must contain multiple transactions of which each one consists of multiple items. Item sets are
considered frequent, if their support is greater or equal than a specific threshold.</p>
</td>

<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.tasks/-frequent-item-set-miner-task/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.tasks.FrequentItemSetMinerTask</a></td>

<p>A task, which tries to find a specific number of frequent item sets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-frequent-item-sets/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.FrequentItemSets</a></td>
<td>
<p>A sorted set, which contains frequent item sets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.operators/-harmonic-mean/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.operators.HarmonicMean</a></td>
<td>
<p>An operator, which allows to average the heuristic values, which are calculated by applying
multiple metrics to a rule, according to the harmonic mean operation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-item.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Item</a></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the interface, an item, which is part of a <a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-transaction.html">Transaction</a>, must implement. The Apriori
algorithm relies on items to correctly implement the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()">Object.hashCode</a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)">Object.equals</a>
methods to be able to compare items to each other. Furthermore, the interface <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-comparable/index.html">Comparable</a> must
be implemented. This allows to sort items (e.g. by their names) in order to generate candidates
in an efficient way, when searching for frequent item sets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-item-set/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.ItemSet</a></td>
<td>
<p>An item set, which may contain several items. An item set may not contain duplicates. The
contained items are ordered according to the implementation of their <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-comparable/compare-to.html">Comparable.compareTo</a>
method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.metrics/-leverage/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.metrics.Leverage</a></td>
<td>
<p>A metric, which measures the leverage of an association rule. By definition, leverage is the
difference between the rule's support and the expected support for the body and head, if they
were independent. Furthermore, the leverage of a rule is a lower bound for its support. As a
consequence, in contrast to optimizing confidence or lift, optimizing the leverage of a rule
guarantees a certain minimum support.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.metrics/-lift/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.metrics.Lift</a></td>
<td>
<p>A metric, which measures the lift of an association rule (also referred to as "interest"). By
definition, lift is calculated as the ratio of the rule's confidence over a priori expectation
for the rule's head.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Metric</a></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a class, which allows to measure the "interestingly" of association rules
according to a certain metric, must implement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-operator/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Operator</a></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a class, which allows to calculate heuristic values of association rules,
must implement. This applies to metrics, which measure the "interestingly" of rules, as well as
to meta-heuristics, which average the results of multiple metrics.</p>

set, are unordered by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a data structure, which is sortable using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-comparable/index.html">Comparable</a> or <a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-sorting/index.html">Sorting</a>
instances, must implement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-sorting/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Sorting</a></td>
<td>
<p>A sorting, which specifies how item sets or association rules should be sorted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.metrics/-support/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.metrics.Support</a></td>
<td>
<p>A metric, which measures the support of an association rule. By definition, support measures the
percentage of transactions for which the body and head of the rule is true.</p>
</td>

<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-tie-breaker/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.TieBreaker</a></td>
<td>
<p>A tie-breaking strategy, which allows to decide, which one of two item sets or association rules
should be sorted before the other one, if their heuristic values are equal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-transaction.html">de.mrapp.apriori.Transaction</a></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the interface, a transaction, which consists of multiple items, must implement. The
Apriori algorithm processes a set of transactions in order to find frequent item sets.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori.datastructure/-transactional-item-set/index.html">de.mrapp.apriori.datastructure.TransactionalItemSet</a></td>
