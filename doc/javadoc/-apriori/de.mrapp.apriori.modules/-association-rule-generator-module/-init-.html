<p>A module, which allows to generate association rules from frequent item sets. An association rule
specifies, that if certain items occur in a transaction, other items do also occur with a certain
probability. Among all possible association rules, which can be generated from the frequent item
sets, only those, whose "interestingly" according to the confidence metric is greater or equal
than a specific threshold, are taken into account.</p>
<p>In order to prune the search for association rules, the algorithm exploits the anti-monotonicity
property of the confidence metric, which states, that the confidence of the rule A,B -&amp;gt; C is
an upper bound to the confidence of a rule A -&amp;gt; B,C. Consequently, the algorithm starts by
generating rules, which contain a single item in there heads. Based on those rules, which reach
the minimum confidence, additional rules are created by moving items from their bodies to the
heads. For each rule said process is continued until the minimum threshold cannot be reached
anymore.</p>
