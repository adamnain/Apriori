<p>A metric, which measures the conviction of an association rule. By definition, conviction is the
ratio of the expected frequency that a rule makes an incorrect prediction, if body and head were
independent, over the frequency of incorrect predictions. For example, a conviction of 1.2
states, that the items, which are contained in the body and head of a rule, occur together 1.2
times as often as if the association between head and body was purely random.</p>
