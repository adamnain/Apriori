<h3>Types</h3>
<table>

<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Confidence</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html"><span class="identifier">Metric</span></a></code>
<p>A metric, which measures the confidence of an association rule. By definition, confidence
measures the percentage of transactions for which the head of the rule is true, among all
transaction for which the body is true.</p>

<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Conviction</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html"><span class="identifier">Metric</span></a></code>
<p>A metric, which measures the conviction of an association rule. By definition, conviction is the
ratio of the expected frequency that a rule makes an incorrect prediction, if body and head were
independent, over the frequency of incorrect predictions. For example, a conviction of 1.2
states, that the items, which are contained in the body and head of a rule, occur together 1.2
times as often as if the association between head and body was purely random.</p>

<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Leverage</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html"><span class="identifier">Metric</span></a></code>
<p>A metric, which measures the leverage of an association rule. By definition, leverage is the
difference between the rule's support and the expected support for the body and head, if they
were independent. Furthermore, the leverage of a rule is a lower bound for its support. As a
consequence, in contrast to optimizing confidence or lift, optimizing the leverage of a rule
guarantees a certain minimum support.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-lift/index.html">Lift</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Lift</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html"><span class="identifier">Metric</span></a></code>
<p>A metric, which measures the lift of an association rule (also referred to as "interest"). By
definition, lift is calculated as the ratio of the rule's confidence over a priori expectation
for the rule's head.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p><a href="-support/index.html">Support</a></p>
</td>

<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Support</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../de.mrapp.apriori/-metric/index.html"><span class="identifier">Metric</span></a></code>
<p>A metric, which measures the support of an association rule. By definition, support measures the
percentage of transactions for which the body and head of the rule is true.</p>
